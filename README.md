Yamato is a fitness trainer in the bay area who was a Vines.design client, as well as a friend. We created a custom logo for her, choosing her brand colors for the logo and the rest of the site. We took professional photos of her at our studio in order to give a great splash image. We then wireframed their website and built it out by hand using PHP, HTML, and CSS, and borrowing some components from UIkit3.
